# Sales Report App - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Sales Report App is a web application with a chat-based interface designed for sales agents to log shop visits, track customer contacts, and record sales activities. The application integrates with a Supabase database to store and retrieve data about sales activities, customer information, and product details.

## Key Features

- **Chat-based Form Interface**: Intuitive, conversational UI for data entry
- **Shop Autocomplete**: Type-ahead suggestions after 3 characters
- **Geolocation Capture**: Automatic location tracking for visit verification
- **Customer Contact Management**: Record and manage shop contacts
- **Phone Number Logic**: Smart handling of customer phone numbers
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of who created and updated records

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Vite, React Router, Context API
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Simple employee ID verification
- **Geolocation**: Browser's Geolocation API
- **Form Management**: Custom form state management with React Context
