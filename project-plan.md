## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Supabase integration challenges | Medium | High | Early proof-of-concept, dedicated spike for database integration |
| Geolocation compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive browser testing, fallback mechanisms |
| Chat interface usability problems | Medium | High | Early user testing, iterative design approach |
| Performance issues with autocomplete | Low | Medium | Implement proper debouncing, optimize queries |
| Mobile responsiveness challenges | Medium | Medium | Mobile-first design approach, regular testing on devices |
| Deployment delays | Medium | High | Prepare deployment scripts early, automate where possible |
